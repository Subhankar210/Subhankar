            external businesses. This exposes them to the outside world and hacking.System hacking means using computers to <br>

          <h3>⭐Types of Hacker</h3>
          <p class=skill2-description>Generally Hacker's are three types.<br> <strong>1. 💙Blackhat Hacker <br> 2. 💙Whitehat Hacker <br> 3. 💙Greyhat Hacker</strong><br>
            <strong>1. 💙Black Hat Hacker</strong><br>
            Black-hat Hackers are also known as an Unethical Hacker or a Security Cracker. These people hack the system <br>
            illegally to steal money or to achieve their own illegal goals. They find banks or other companies with weak <br>
            security and steal money or credit card information. They can also modify or destroy the data as well. Black hat hacking is illegal.


            <br><strong> 2. 💙White Hat Hacker <br></strong>
            White hat Hackers are also known as Ethical Hackers or a Penetration Tester. White hat hackers are the good guys of the hacker world.<br>
            These people use the same technique used by the black hat hackers. They also hack the system, but they can only hack the system that they <br>
            have permission to hack in order to test the security of the system. They focus on security and protecting IT system. White hat hacking is legal. <br>


            <br> <strong>3. 💙Gray Hat Hacker</strong><br>
            Gray hat Hackers are Hybrid between Black hat Hackers and White hat hackers. They can hack any system even if they don't have permission to test <br>
             the security of the system but they will never steal money or damage the system.In most cases, they tell the administrator of that system.But<br>
             they are also illegal because they test the security of the system that they do not have permission to test. Grey hat hacking is sometimes  <br>
             acted legally and sometimes not.
